# Contributing to WereLogs

Contributing to WereLogs can take multiple shapes:
 * Reporting a bug
 * Requesting/Suggesting/Discussing a feature
 * Providing Code:
   - a bug fix
   - a new feature
   - improving the documentation

Each of these shapes of contribution must comply to a given set of rules, to
facilitate cooperation.

## Discussing the project

This project is an opensource project, provided to you by other developers, and
they too, are human. Thus, please try to explain your point of view when
discussing a feature or bug, with examples, ascii art drawings, in an organized
discourse. This should help everyone understand your point better, as well as
it creates a context and cordial exchange between people. At any moment, try to
keep your calm, and avoid flaming, as it never helps any discussion, and surely
repulses some of the other contributors.

Summarizing:
 * Keep calm and stay cordial
 * Explain your point, using the help of samples of code, ascii art diagrams
 etc.

## Reporting an Issue

In order to report a bug, here are a few rules that can help both the
reporter as well as the developer of the project:
 * A bug report's name must shortly describe the user-side effect of the bug
 * A bug report's body must provide the following informations:
   - Describe in detail the effect of the bug in an expected usage situation
   - Provide information about the setup in which werelogs is used, if you feel
   it is relevant.
Some additional useful information for a bug report can be:
   - Running environment
   - A sample of code that triggers the bug (REALLY helpful and appreciated)
   - Describe any potential work-around found for the bug

## Requesting or Suggesting a feature

In order for any feature suggestion to be clear, please comply to the following
basic rules:
 * Issue title must be clear about the feature (a clear and semantic name might
 help) and what value it adds to the project
 * The description of the suggestion must provide insight into:
   - What the feature provides
   - At least one use-case of the feature (to show the value of it for the
   project)
   - If thought of, one suggestion as to how technically implement the feature
