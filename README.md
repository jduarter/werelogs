# WereLogs

This repository provides a NodeJS Library that aims to be an efficient logging
library, reducing as much as possible the need to compute anything in NodeJS,
and focusing on a simple I/O scheme. The goal here is to make the most of
NodeJS's strengths, but relying on its I/O capacities, and avoiding any form of
computation that is known to not be advantageous in Node.
