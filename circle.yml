        # running ft_test packs werelogs and installs it + deps into
        # tests/functional. Pack is like publishing werelogs in a local tgz
        # archive that can be installed.
        # This step shall ensure that no issue is encountered when installing
        # the package, and allows to functionally test werelogs.
